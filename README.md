# tdd
Attempt of test driven development.
All code was written in comply with book of Harry Percival about TDD, 
thanks him for this book.
### Workflow
1. Start by writing functional tests. Describes new 
functionality from user`s point.
1. Once functional tests fail, we starts thinking about how
to write a code. We use unit tests to define how we want our 
code to behave.
1. Once we have a failing unit test we start to write an app code, 
just enough to get the unit test pass. We may iterate between
2d and 3d points until all unit test will be passed.
1. Then we return to functional tests they may prompt us 
to write new unit tests.

#####Note
*Functional tests should help you build an application 
with the right functionality, and guarantee you never 
accidentally break it. Unit tests should help you to 
write code thatâ€™s clean and bug free.*
